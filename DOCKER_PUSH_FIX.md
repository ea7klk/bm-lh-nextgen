# Docker Registry Push Issue - Fixed

## 🔍 **Root Cause Identified**

The Docker images weren't being pushed because of this line in the workflow:
```yaml
push: ${{ github.event_name != 'workflow_dispatch' }}
```

This meant:
- ✅ Images would push on tag releases 
- ❌ Images would NOT push on manual workflow dispatch
- ❌ If you were testing with manual triggers, nothing got pushed

## 🔧 **Changes Made**

### 1. **Fixed Push Logic**
```yaml
# Before (problematic)
push: ${{ github.event_name != 'workflow_dispatch' }}

# After (fixed)  
push: true
```

### 2. **Enhanced Tag Generation**
Added support for manual workflow dispatch to generate `latest` tag:
```yaml
tags: |
  type=ref,event=branch
  type=ref,event=pr  
  type=semver,pattern={{version}}
  type=semver,pattern={{major}}.{{minor}}
  type=raw,value=latest,enable={{is_default_branch}}
  type=raw,value=latest,enable=${{ github.event_name == 'workflow_dispatch' }}  # ← Added
```

### 3. **Added Debug Information**
- Registry access verification
- Tag generation debugging
- Push result confirmation
- Clear logging of what's happening

### 4. **Created Test Workflow**
New file: `.github/workflows/test-docker-push.yml`
- Simple test to verify registry push works
- Creates test images with unique tags
- Manual trigger only for testing

## 🧪 **Testing the Fix**

### Option 1: Manual Workflow Dispatch
1. Go to your repository → Actions tab
2. Click "Docker Build and Push" workflow  
3. Click "Run workflow" button
4. Check the logs for successful push

### Option 2: Use Test Workflow
1. Go to Actions → "Test Docker Push"
2. Click "Run workflow"
3. This creates a simple test image to verify registry access

### Option 3: Create a Version Tag
```bash
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Test release v1.0.0"
git push origin v1.0.0
```

## 🎯 **Expected Results**

After the fix, you should see:

### **In Workflow Logs:**
```
Debug metadata
Event name: workflow_dispatch
Ref: refs/heads/main
Tags: ghcr.io/ea7klk/bm-lh-nextgen:latest

✅ Building and pushing Docker image...
✅ Build completed. Checking if images were pushed...
```

### **In Repository Packages:**
- Go to your repository → Packages tab
- You should see `bm-lh-nextgen` package
- With tags like `latest`, version numbers, etc.

### **Pull Commands:**
```bash
# Pull the latest image
docker pull ghcr.io/ea7klk/bm-lh-nextgen:latest

# Test it works
docker run -p 3000:3000 \
  -e ADMIN_PASSWORD=test123 \
  -e JWT_SECRET=test-secret \
  ghcr.io/ea7klk/bm-lh-nextgen:latest
```

## 🛠 **Troubleshooting**

### If Still Not Working:

1. **Check Repository Settings:**
   - Go to Settings → Actions → General
   - Ensure "Read and write permissions" is enabled
   - Check "Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests"

2. **Check Package Visibility:**
   - Go to repository → Packages
   - Click on your package → Package settings
   - Ensure visibility is set correctly

3. **Verify Permissions:**
   - The workflow has `packages: write` permission
   - Your personal access token (if used) has package permissions

4. **Check Registry URL:**
   - Should be `ghcr.io/ea7klk/bm-lh-nextgen`
   - Not `docker.io` or other registries

### Common Issues:
- **"unauthorized"** → Check repository permissions in Settings
- **"package not found"** → Package visibility or naming issue  
- **"workflow failed"** → Check specific step logs for details

## 🚀 **Next Steps**

1. **Test the fix** with manual workflow dispatch
2. **Verify package appears** in repository Packages tab
3. **Test pulling and running** the published image
4. **Create a proper release tag** for v1.0.0
5. **Document the image usage** for others

The workflows should now push Docker images successfully to GitHub Container Registry! 🎉
